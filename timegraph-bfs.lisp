;; Breadth first traversal on timegraph
;; The semantics of the search are determined by overlap?, reverse?, and start-at-end?
;; overlap? and reverse? false => returns all episodes which begin after e1.
;; overlap? true, reverse? false => returns all episodes which end after e1.
;; overlap? false, reverse? true => returns all episodes which end before e1.
;; overlap? true, reverse? true => returns all episodes which begin before e1.
;; The start-at-end? option determines where the search starts from. By default (nil)
;; the search starts from the beginning of e1. If T, then the search starts from the
;; end of e1.
